        <h1>The Rock biography</h1>
        <p>
            Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson was born into a professional wrestling family in 1972. 
            An injury ended his college football career, so he entered the ring with the WWE. 
            As "The Rock," he famously feuded with wrestler Steve Austin and won the WWE Heavyweight title numerous times.
